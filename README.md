Improve your programming speed by practicing with real Typescript code examples.

## Who is this for?

Primarily this app is for me. My whole life I have been typing with the incorrect form, and as a result my coding speed has been limited by slow and inaccurate typing.

To address this issue I have been learning to touch type with the correct form using online touch typing programs like <strong>typing club</strong> and <strong>keybr.</strong> After a couple of months my accuracy and speed is already a lot better, however when I transitioned to writing real code in an editor it felt like I was back to square one.

Code (and Typescript code in particular) has a lot of characters and symbols that are rarely exercised in existing online programs. Touch typing relies on developing muscle memory, in code the same patterns of syntax and characters are typed over and over again.

So I developed a solution.

This is an touch typing app with a difference. Practice with real typescript code examples and build your speed and confidence code snippets like this that are a far cry from the <i>quick brown foxes jumping over sleeping dogs!! ü¶äüí§üê∂.<i>

```typescript
function removeSorted<T>(array: SortedArray<T>, remove: T, compare: Comparer<T>): void {
        if (!array || array.length === 0) {
            return;
        }
```
